# AtomicOrbit: Electron Orbital Visualization Tool

AtomicOrbit is a powerful Python tool for visualizing electron orbitals in atoms based on their quantum numbers. It provides both 3D interactive plots and a command-line interface for easy use.

## Features

- Generate 3D visualizations of electron orbitals
- Support for single orbital, multiple orbitals, and all orbitals plot types
- Interactive 3D plots using Plotly
- Command-line interface for easy use
- Support for atoms up to atomic number 60

## Installation

To install AtomicOrbit, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AtomicOrbit.git
   cd AtomicOrbit
   ```
3. Install the package using pip:
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

## Usage

AtomicOrbit can be used via the command line. Here are some example commands:

1. Visualize a single orbital:
   ```
   atomicorbit -p single -n 2 -l 1 -m 0
   ```

2. Visualize all orbitals for carbon:
   ```
   atomicorbit -a carbon -p all
   ```

3. Visualize multiple orbitals for an atom with 29 electrons (copper):
   ```
   atomicorbit -e 29 -p multiple
   ```

For more options and information, use the help command:
```
atomicorbit -h
```

## Examples

Here are some example visualizations generated by AtomicOrbit:

1. Single orbital (2p):
